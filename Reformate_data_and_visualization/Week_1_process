We have done some data visualization for moving average and other basic perspective. 
The code contained is the R code for data reformating and data visualization for moving average.
The R code could be generally used to conduct data wrangling to ensure the time series data could 
have a frequency of 365. (As originally some days are missing.)
The Moving Average of 7 days 30 days 180 days plots and values could be generated by using the code as well.
If you have any question about the code, please leave a message in the slack!
